        And these include the following 
        <ol>
           <li>Swimming</li>
           <p>Swimming being one of my hobbies takes most of the time i get to relax from studies 
            and any kind of stress because it makes me get calm and this helps me to relax
        Here are some pictures of me having some good time and fun while swimming with my friends
